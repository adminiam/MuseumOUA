                        Humanitarian University did not begin immediately on August 20, 2002. First and foremost,
                        <span class="uk-text-bold">it was necessary to license the academic programs with the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine</span>.
                        Since IHU was one of the first private higher education institutions in independent Ukraine,
                        and <span class="uk-text-bold">the first non-state university of such scale, the licensing process was extremely challenging</span>.

                        our curricula and faculty were discussed at the Ministry, <span
                                    class="uk-text-bold">literally, every program underwent rigorous scrutiny</span>. When licensing the 'Enterprise Economics' program, the expert council of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine at Kyiv National Economic University
                        rejected our application twice, and <span class="uk-text-bold">it was only after the third meeting that we received a positive outcome</span>."</span>

                    <h2>Creating the University's Symbolism</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another crucial task undertaken by the small
                        team at IHU—comprising just five members at the time (the president, rector, first vice-rector,
                        accountant, and dispatcher)—before enrolling students was <span class="uk-text-bold">the creation of the university's coat of arms</span>.
                        At that time, only a few higher education institutions in Ukraine had their own heraldic
                        symbols, yet for an institution with an international scope, this was of great importance.
                        Therefore, the IHU team approached this endeavor with a deep sense of responsibility: <span
                                class="uk-text-bold">they consulted
        heraldry experts</span>, invited artists and designers. The task was entrusted to
                        <span class="uk-text-bold">members of the
        Union of Artists of Ukraine</span>. The university adopted the Latin motto "Pro bono
                        publico" —
                        "For the public good." Since then, <span class="uk-text-bold">this coat of arms has become the official symbol of the university, adorning numerous IHU documents</span>
                        with its refined aesthetics, printed materials, and later
                        serving as an inspiration for the emblems of the International Academic School "Odesa" and the
                        International Educational
                        Corporation.

                        led to an unexpected and promising development for the university — <span

                        Encyclopedia
                        Britannica, "Millennium Library," and books from various fields. Following the good traditions
                        of Odesa
                        National Law Academy, the young team of IHU placed significant emphasis on developing the
                        scientific library. Thus, in 2003, the University acquired 50,000, and in 2004 – 80,000
                        copies for the library's book collection.

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 13, 2005, another
                        significant event occurred – the International Humanitarian University <span
                                class="uk-text-bold">moved to a new building at the 5th station of
                            Velykyi Fontan, which quickly took on a new appearance.</span> The founders transformed
                        a 3-story building
                        into a 5-story one and thoroughly renovated the premises.
                        <span class="uk-text-bold">The large courtyard was transformed into a true work of park art</span>,
                        where a
                        sculptural group honoring the founders of IHU was harmoniously placed. It was created by the
                        famous Odesa artist, Honored
                        Artist of Ukraine <span class="uk-text-bold">Oleksandr Kniazyk.</span>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, the development of the university's material and technical
                        base took place on a self-financing basis. Thus, due to the high scientific
                        activity of university professors, the Academic Council of the University decided <span
                                class="uk-text-bold">to
                            establish its own periodical publication</span>. Based on the decision of the State
                        Committee of
                        Television and
                        Radio Broadcasting of Ukraine, the university was issued a certificate <span
                                class="uk-text-bold">for the right to publish a domestic national periodical publication under the name "Scientific Notes of the International Humanitarian
