                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year 2010 was, without exaggeration, a year of historic changes and
                        significant events in the life of the Law Academy. By the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of
                        Ukraine dated July 28, 2010, which was approved by the Presidential Decree of Ukraine, <span

                        Symbolically, the document was signed by the Head of State on September 2, 2010 – the birthday
                        of the city of Odesa. In this way, the country's leadership emphasized the university's
                        importance for the development of the city and the entire Odesa region. The status of a National
                        University <span class="uk-text-bold">opens up new opportunities for implementing ambitious plans.</span>
                        Ideas begin to materialize, but not without the diligent efforts of the institution's staff.

                        Academy" has significantly improved. One of the most notable achievements was the opening of
                        <span class="uk-text-bold"><a class="uk-text-underline" href="../link-tree/SportComplex8.html">the open-air sports and wellness complex "University"</a></span>
                        on the shore of the Black Sea at the 8th station of the Great Fountain. The total area of the
                        sports complex reached 2,750 square meters, <span class="uk-text-bold">the largest among all educational wellness facilities</span>
                        built since Ukraine's independence. The "University" complex featured—and still maintains—a
                        sports field with <span class="uk-text-bold">spectator stands for 1,000 people</span>, as well
                        as fields for mini-football, basketball, and volleyball; a clay tennis court; and an open-air
                        gym.

                        courts, and sports centers worldwide. The grand opening took place in 2012, and it is no
                        coincidence that "University" quickly became a favorite place for sports and recreation not only
                        for students and faculty but also for all residents of Odesa.

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the young Ukrainian state developed, there arose a <span

                        To address this demand, on July 13, 2010, the <span class="uk-text-bold">Faculty of Legal Political Science and Sociology</span>
                        was established at the university. From its inception, this faculty became one of the most
                        prestigious not only in Odesa but across the country. The curriculum focuses on applied <span
                                class="uk-text-bold">sociology and political science, psychology</span>, law, and
                        foreign languages. Notably, the latter became possible with the establishment of the <span

                        specifically to support these disciplines.

                        journalists, and experts, was outlined by the chairman, Serhii Kivalov: "We cannot adopt a
                        separate law specifically for the judiciary. We adopt laws to make it easier for citizens to
                        resolve disputes that arise in their interactions with state institutions."
