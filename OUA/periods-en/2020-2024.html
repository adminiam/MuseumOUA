                    <p class="uk-text-large">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modern development phase of the Odesa Law
                        Academy is characterized by the active implementation of advanced teaching methodologies, the
                        expansion of information technologies within the University, and the strengthening of
                        international relations. Despite the restrictions imposed in 2020 due to the spread of the
                        coronavirus infection and in 2022 as a result of military aggression, the educational process at
                        NU "OLA" never ceased and was in no way simplified. Since the 1990s, the institution has upheld
                        an unwavering goal—to remain the flagship of higher legal education in Ukraine, no matter the
                        circumstances.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2020, the Faculty of Cybersecurity and Information
                        Technologies inaugurated two innovative laboratories: the Robotics and Information Technology
                        Laboratory and the specialized "KeepSolid" Laboratory. This new scientific space provides
                        students with the opportunity to refine their skills in 3D modeling, robot design, and the
                        development and operation of complex information security systems.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facility is equipped with a specialized access control system using
                        contactless cards, which identifies all visitors and sends notifications to those responsible
                        for access. Future cybersecurity specialists immediately began developing a monitoring system in
                        the new laboratories using facial recognition technology and artificial intelligence. The
                        official opening ceremony was attended by the Deputy Minister of Education and Science of
                        Ukraine, Ihor Garbaruk.</p>

                        International Humanitarian University. Within just a month, lecture halls were converted into
                        intensive care units, and a COVID-19 Response Center was rapidly set up. A total of 15,000
                        COVID-19 test kits were procured, along with modern ventilators, oxygen cylinders, infusion
                        pumps, and other essential medical equipment. As part of a social initiative, tens of thousands

                        Agafangel of Odesa and Izmail, lasted nearly 10 years. The founder of the "School of the

                        Europe.</p>

                        accommodate 1,200 students. It features an indoor sports complex, a spacious gymnasium, an
                        Olympic-standard swimming pool with six lanes, a smaller pool for younger children, a school
                        café, and a cinema and concert hall with 800 seats. Enhancing the architectural ensemble, the
