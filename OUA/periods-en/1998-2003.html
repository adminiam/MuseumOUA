                <h2>Summing Up the Period</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="uk-text-bold">Thus, the years 1998–2003 marked a new era in the history of domestic legal education and the Odessa School of Law in particular</span>.
                    However,
                    the Odessa National Academy of Law, having set a high pace of development and expansion, did not
                    intend to
                    stop. Instead, it continued to move forward, <span class="uk-text-bold">pursuing a single goal—to become the best higher educational
                            institution not only in Ukraine but also in Europe.</span></p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For his significant contribution to the development of legal
                    science and the state as a whole, <span class="uk-text-bold">the founder and rector of the Odessa National Academy of Law, Serhiy
                        Kivalov, was awarded numerous departmental, state, and international honors during this period</span>.
                    Among the most notable distinctions were: <span class="uk-text-bold">The Order of Merit III Class (1997)</span>,
                    II Class (1999), and I Class (2002); The Order of Prince Yaroslav
                    the Wise V Class (2004) and IV
                    Class (2011); The Honored Lawyer of Ukraine badge (1998).</p>
