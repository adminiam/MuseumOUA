                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the National University «Odesa
                        Law Academy» dates back long before the fateful decision to establish the Odesa Law Academy.
                        Specifically, almost two hundred years before Ukraine gained statehood and independence. During
                        this time, the fundamental concepts, principles, and traditions that today's students and
                        faculty of the National University «Odesa Law Academy» uphold and develop were formed.

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National University «Odesa Law Academy» is the successor to the rich
                        traditions of the Odesa School of Law. It is worth noting that a scientific school is a type of
                        scientific community and a special form of cooperation in scientific activities. The development
                        of many branches of science is directly linked to the activities of scientific schools.
                        <span class="uk-text-bold">Thus, the history of the Law Academy begins with the emergence and development of the Odesa School of Law, dating back to 1817.</span>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the 19th century, in the context of the
                        specialization of educational institutions in Ukraine, a new system for training legal
                        professionals began to take shape. Institutions providing universal legal education, such as law
                        faculties of universities and departmental institutions, started operating. Additionally,
                        specialized legal lyceums were established, concentrating competent legal scholars and
                        practitioners within a single region, thereby forming distinct schools of law.

                        administrative, and economic spheres in Ukraine. The Richelieu Lyceum was chosen as the
                        institution that would bring together the brightest minds of the region and facilitate necessary
                        communication between science and industry. This secondary educational institution was founded
                        on May 2, 1817, based on the Odesa Noble Institute. The lyceum was named after Duke de
                        Richelieu, who, with the support of Minister of Public Education Count O. K. Rozumovsky (a
                        descendant of the former Ukrainian Hetman Kyrylo Rozumovsky), actively contributed to the
                        advancement of education in Ukraine.

                        development of the young Richelieu Lyceum. Consequently, on July 30, 1830, when a decree was
                        issued establishing the Odesa Educational District, the Richelieu Lyceum was logically chosen as

                        implementation of bourgeois-democratic reforms in the state, the development of legal education
                        in regional universities faced the challenge of training legal professionals capable of
                        operating in accordance with the demands of the new era. Thus, the task of legal education
                        became to provide society with a significant reservoir of scientific knowledge. Additionally,
                        the rapidly expanding system of legal disciplines—shaped by the dynamic development of
                        capitalism—required a strong theoretical and methodological foundation.
