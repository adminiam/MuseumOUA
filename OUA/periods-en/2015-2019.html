                        Academy" placed
                        significant emphasis on expanding educational and scientific cooperation with <span

                        organizations. The goal was to <span class="uk-text-bold">provide students with opportunities for internships and employment in the most developed countries worldwide.</span>
                        This effort was preceded by the establishment of the <span class="uk-text-bold">International Relations Department</span>
                        in 1997, which has always been led by the "best of the best"—the most competent and experienced

                        whether it was true that Odesa is a city of happy people.

                        Despite the simplicity of the question, the survey had an extremely important goal – to provide
                        students with practical experience in conducting large-scale sociological research, processing,
                        and analyzing statistical data and public opinion.
