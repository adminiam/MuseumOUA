                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of creating a «School of the Future»—an educational institution
                        with <span class="uk-text-bold">everything necessary for developing children's talents, including cutting-edge technologies, innovative teaching methods, experienced teachers</span>,
                        spiritual education, comfortable learning conditions, and safety—emerged long before
                        construction began. As the founder and president of the International Academic School Odessa,
                        Serhii Kivalov, recalled, the vision was to build a school where "<span
                                class="uk-text-bold uk-text-italic">…at the center stands a temple, with academic buildings radiating outward like sunbeams</span>."
                        The school was initially <span class="uk-text-bold">designed to include a swimming pool, the most modern sports complex, a large cinema and concert hall, and a spacious dining hall</span>
                        to ensure students' physical and spiritual well-being.

                    <h2>The Blessing of the Construction Site</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among Odessa residents, the institution was initially referred to as a
                        <span class="uk-text-bold">«church-parish school»</span>. The first steps toward creating the
                        School of the Future began on December 2, 2011, with the <span class="uk-text-bold">development of the school building's project</span>
                        and the start of its construction. The design process commenced immediately after the school's
                        blessing. On this day, at a location where some businessmen had planned to build entertainment
                        venues and high-rises, <span class="uk-text-bold">a sacred stone was placed to symbolize the beginning of the school's construction</span>
                        at 30 Akademichna Street. </p>

                        The date of the blessing was not chosen by chance: December 2 also marks the anniversary of the
                        National University «Odessa Law Academy».

                        After the blessing of the site, the focus shifted to detailed planning—<span

                        and even more. An idea alone was not enough; without professional visualization and technical
                        project planning, it could not become a reality. This is where the <span class="uk-text-bold">team from the Odessa State Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture</span>
                        stepped in to help.

                        visualizations and <span class="uk-text-bold">architectural proposals</span>, collaborating on

                    <h2>The Start of Construction</h2>
                    <p> A new chapter in the history of the School of the Future began on June 8, 2012. Headlines in
                        both regional and national media declared: <span class="uk-text-bold uk-text-italic">«Odessa becomes the first city in Ukraine to build an international-standard educational complex»</span>.
                        That summer day was a moment of unity for Odessa's most influential figures. Standing alongside
                        Serhii Kivalov <span class="uk-text-bold">in early June 2012 were representatives of the Odessa City Hall, Odesa Governor Eduard Matviychuk, and Members of Parliament of Ukraine</span>.
                        Everyone pledged their active support and assistance in bringing the project to life. The city
                        authorities worked tirelessly <span class="uk-text-bold">to complete their part as quickly as possible</span>,
                        creating the conditions necessary for the rapid construction of this architectural and spiritual
                        landmark.
                        As it seemed then, all future friends and supporters of the School of the Future took part in
                        the ceremonial construction of this symbolic educational institution.</p>

                        Creating something unique in the face of constant resistance would be the reality for the next
                        several years. However, there was no turning back—and no intention of stopping.

                    <h2>The Beginning of the Student Temple's Construction</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July 1, 2013, a significant event took place—on the school's
                        construction site, <span class="uk-text-bold">a time capsule was ceremoniously placed at the foundation of the temple, which was named in honor of St. Sergius of Radonezh</span>.
                        The capsule was laid by <span
                                class="uk-text-bold">Metropolitan Agafangel of Odessa and Izmail</span>, the initiator
                        of the complex's construction <span class="uk-text-bold">Serhii Kivalov, Governor Eduard Matviychuk</span>,
                        clergy members, and local residents who supported the project.

                <div class="six columns right text margin-fixed-left">
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major advocate for the school's protection was <span
                            class="uk-text-bold">Metropolitan Agafangel</span>, who, in July 2013, personally appealed
                        to Mayor Oleksii Kostusev and city council deputies, <span class="uk-text-bold">urging them not to obstruct the construction of Ukraine's first general education church-parish school</span>.
                        In a written statement, the metropolitan reminded officials that he had blessed the site back in
                        December 2011 in the presence of city authorities and law enforcement. Seeing such strong public
                        support, city council deputies could not ignore the will of their voters. <span
                                class="uk-text-bold">In the end, representatives of nearly all factions in the city council voted in favor of the school, with only six opposing votes</span>.

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year 2014. War, political and economic crises, an endless election cycle.
                        <span class="uk-text-bold">Almost all infrastructure projects in the city and country were frozen</span>.
                        For the School of the Future, this was a crucial year. Despite the turmoil, <span
                                class="uk-text-bold">construction continued, and by 2014, the complex had already reached three full floors.</span>
                        Work never stopped—there was a blessing and a determination to complete what had taken so much
                        effort to begin. The school's area covered <span
                                class="uk-text-bold">22,000 square meters</span>—at this stage, it was no longer just a
                        school but an entire complex.
                    </p>

                <div class="six columns left text margin-fixed-right">
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 19, 2014, Metropolitan Agafangel gave his blessing, and <span
                            class="uk-text-bold">Bishop Diodor of Yuzhne, vicar of the Odessa Diocese, consecrated the cross for the temple of St. Sergius of Radonezh</span>,
                        which was part of Ukraine's first modern church-educational school complex. Then, to the sound
                        of church hymns, <span class="uk-text-bold">a five-meter-high cross, weighing over 200 kilograms, was lifted and placed atop the temple's dome</span>.
                        This event became a symbol—proof that the project would be completed. No global crises could
                        stop Serhii Kivalov from seeing it through.

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eve of Christmas, January 6, 2015, a special service was held at
                        the Temple of St. Sergius of Radonezh, <span class="uk-text-bold">marking the installation of eleven bells on the church-parish school</span>

                        and Izmail. The first bell was placed on the temple's bell tower, standing over 40 meters high.
                        Clergy members who saw and heard the bells remarked: <span class="uk-text-bold uk-text-italic">«These bells do not just ring—they sing»</span>.
