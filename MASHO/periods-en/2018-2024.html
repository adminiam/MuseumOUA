                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 2017, the educational institution <span class="uk-text-bold">had almost fully taken shape</span>
                        – closely resembling the vision talented Odessa architects had designed back in 2012. <span
                                class="uk-text-bold">Finishing work was in full swing in the spacious classrooms, sports hall, swimming pools, and concert hall</span>.
                        For the spiritual development of future students, <span class="uk-text-bold">another temple—St. John the Theologian's Church—was built, located below the Temple of St. Sergius of Radonezh</span>.
                        Notably, in April 2017, the first baptisms were held in the upper temple.

                        By August 2018, it had reached a new level of material infrastructure. The task set by Serhii
                        Kivalov for the contractors was successfully completed – <span class="uk-text-bold">students, teachers, and all staff had to feel comfortable in the school year-round</span>.
                        A comprehensive list of advanced technologies was installed, including <span
                                class="uk-text-bold">solar panels, heat pumps, full ventilation systems, and a modern boiler room</span>.
                        Next to the complex, a powerful <span class="uk-text-bold">heliosystem</span> with 100 solar
                        collectors was installed, ensuring the school remained warm, bright, and cozy—and most

                        Teachers underwent specialized training to work at the School of the Future. Each classroom was
                        equipped with interactive panels and the latest technology, allowing teachers to integrate <span

                        although the school was designed for 1,250 students, it was planned to initially enroll no more
                        than 200. As expected, <span class="uk-text-bold">the School of the Future launched with 100 students in preschool and primary grades</span>.
                        As the institution grew, it expanded its programs and services to include middle and high school
                        levels.

                        the school's material infrastructure was enhanced with an outdoor sports complex featuring a

                        self-governance body. Students from grades 5 to 10 actively participated, nominating candidates
                        and voting for representatives from each grade level. In total, 14 parliament members were
                        elected, including the Head of the Student Parliament.
