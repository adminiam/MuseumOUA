                    <h2>The Pandemic – No Obstacle to Development</h2>
                    <p>
                        Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related restrictions on the
                        educational process, the period from 2019 to 2021 was remarkably eventful for the Kyiv Institute
                        of Intellectual Property and Law. Above all, this period was marked by the development of
                        cooperation programs with national and European institutions to enhance student employment
                        opportunities.

                    <p>
                        In February 2019, a memorandum of cooperation was signed with the Main Territorial Department of
                        Justice in Kyiv. The key objective of this agreement was to provide students of the Institute
                        with comprehensive exposure to all practical aspects of notarial activities, the implementation
                        of state legal policy, the enforcement of court decisions, the legalization of civil
                        associations, expert support for justice, and the fight against money laundering. This
                        initiative significantly contributed to the employment of university graduates in Kyiv’s justice
                        institutions and increased the involvement of practicing professionals in the Institute’s
                        teaching process.

                        for two years. Upon completion of the military training program, students will have the

                        their higher education diploma.
